                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>MediCost was founded with a clear mission: to make healthcare costs more transparent and predictable for everyone. We believe that by providing accurate cost predictions, we can help individuals and families make better healthcare decisions and plan for their financial future.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>Our platform uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to predict medical costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and geographic region. These predictions provide a reliable estimate that can help you understand potential healthcare expenses.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We've developed our prediction model using extensive healthcare cost data and continuous refinement. While no prediction can be 100% accurate, our system provides estimates that can serve as a valuable reference point for your healthcare planning.</p>
